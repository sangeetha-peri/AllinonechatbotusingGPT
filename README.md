**Purpose**:  
The code implements a **Streamlit application** that leverages **GPT-4 Turbo** and other tools to perform three main tasks:
1. Summarize content from uploaded PDF documents.
2. Enable a chatbot to answer questions based on the content of uploaded PDFs.
3. Compare summaries of documents from two different folders for tender analysis.

### Key Components:

#### **1. Setup and Configuration**:
- **Environment Loading**: 
  - Loads API keys and other configurations using the `dotenv` library to access sensitive credentials securely.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - Tools like `PyPDF2` for PDF reading, `FAISS` for vector-based text retrieval, and `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` for semantic embeddings.
  - Asynchronous OpenAI client for interaction with GPT-4 Turbo.
- **Streamlit UI Setup**:
  - Defines app structure with three tabs: **Summarizer**, **Chatbot**, and **Comparison**.

#### **2. Summarizer Functionality**:
- **Input**: Users upload PDF documents.
- **Process**:
  - Extracts text from the PDFs using `PyPDF2`.
  - Splits text into manageable chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
  - Summarizes the text in smaller, concise outputs using GPT-4 Turbo.
- **Output**: Displays summaries for the uploaded files.

#### **3. Chatbot Functionality**:
- **Input**: Users upload PDF files and ask questions.
- **Process**:
  - Extracts text from PDFs and splits it into chunks for efficient processing.
  - Generates embeddings for the text using `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`.
  - Stores embeddings in FAISS for fast similarity search.
  - Retrieves the most relevant chunks based on user queries.
  - Uses GPT-4 Turbo to generate a response based on the retrieved context.
- **Output**: Provides chatbot responses tailored to the PDF content.

#### **4. Comparison Functionality**:
- **Input**: Users upload PDFs from two folders (e.g., tender details vs. tender quotes).
- **Process**:
  - Extracts and summarizes text from the documents in both folders.
  - Compares summaries using GPT-4 Turbo to identify similarities, differences, and potential mismatches.
- **Output**: Displays comparison results for user review.

### Key Highlights:
- **Efficiency**: Asynchronous programming with `asyncio` ensures that the application handles tasks like querying GPT-4 Turbo efficiently.
- **Modularity**: The application is modular, with clear separation of tasks into summarization, chatbot interaction, and document comparison.
- **Scalability**: Built on Streamlit, it provides a user-friendly interface for seamless document processing and interaction.

This app streamlines document management by combining state-of-the-art AI models with a simple-to-use interface, enhancing productivity for tasks like summarization, knowledge extraction, and document comparison.
